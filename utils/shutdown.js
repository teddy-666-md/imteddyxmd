/**
 * NUCLEAR SHUTDOWN — self-contained 3-kill chain.
 *
 * The process supervisor (panel/pm2/docker) auto-restarts the bot, so a single
 * process.exit() can never keep it offline. The chain persists a small state
 * file that survives restarts and re-kills the process on every boot until
 * the count is spent:
 *
 *   .shutdown (command)  → kill 1/3 — writes { killsLeft: 2 }, then exit(44)
 *   supervisor reboot    → kill 2/3 — chain sees 2, writes 1, exit(44)
 *   supervisor reboot    → kill 3/3 — chain sees 1, deletes state, exit(44)
 *   supervisor reboot    → no state file → boots normally and STAYS ALIVE
 *
 * State file: database/shutdown-state.json
 * Lives inside `database/` on purpose — the loader's mirror-clean wipes the
 * whole bot folder on every sync but never touches its SKIP_DIRS
 * (data/session/database). A state file in the bot root would be deleted on
 * the first restart and the chain would break.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Only fs/path/process — no DB, no Baileys, no dotenv. Runs at the very
 *     top of index.js, before anything else, so the bot dies in the same
 *     tick and never touches auth or connects to WhatsApp during the chain.
 *   - The kill is a SYNCHRONOUS process.exit: index.js is plain top-level
 *     code, so a delayed exit would let it keep booting (half-start). The
 *     kill-path log uses fs.writeSync(2, ...) for the same reason — a normal
 *     console.log can be lost when process.exit() runs in the same tick on a
 *     pipe (pm2/docker log capture).
 *   - Fail-open: any read/parse error → delete state, boot normally. The
 *     helper can never brick the bot.
 *   - Exit code 44 throughout (legacy "Pterodactyl Trap" marker).
 *   - No TTL: the state is trusted until the chain completes naturally.
